Classes based on Fawcet solutions but modified based on the wsdl.

- The Metadata API wsdl can be downloaded from the salesforce org
- The wsdl can be turned into an Apex Class 
- From that class you can choose the classes that are needed, because that class contains everything related to salesforce metadata

One class is being used as a helper class to the soap request, and the other one is the class you can call from flows, pages and apex classes.
